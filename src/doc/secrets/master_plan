The plan is twofold. On one hand, it is to focus on my writing instead of technical details - and help WUT folks to easily do that too. On the other hand, it is to provide Mr. Wayne with a respectable thesis - having *lots* of fun along the way.

Concerning the first sub-goal, I can imagine a highly illustrative sample being just the thing that is the most needed. It needs to show what can be done with Markdown, LaTeX, and Pandoc in a fraction of the time that the process using LaTeX alone takes.

The second sub-goal I leave to your imagination.

The sample thesis is being prepared in Polish first, despite English being used all around in the documentation.
