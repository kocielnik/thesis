  abstract = {As the penetration of variable renewable generation increases in power systems worldwide, planning for the effects of variability will become more important. Traditional capacity adequacy planning techniques have been supplemented with integration studies, which have been carried out in power systems with high targets for renewable generation. These have highlighted the increased variability that a system may experience in the future. As system generation planning techniques evolve with the challenge of integrating variable generation, the ﬂexibility of a system to manage periods of high variability needs to be assessed. The insufﬁcient ramping resource expectation (IRRE) metric is proposed to measure power system ﬂexibility for use in long-term planning, and is derived from traditional generation adequacy metrics. Compared to existing generation adequacy metrics, ﬂexibility assessment is more data intensive. A ﬂexibility metric can identify the time intervals over which a system is most likely to face a shortage of ﬂexible resources, and can measure the relative impact of changing operational policies and the addition of ﬂexible resources. The ﬂexibility of a test system with increasing penetrations of variable generation is assessed. The results highlight the time horizons of increased and decreased risk associated with the integration of VG.},

  abstract = {Power systems are increasingly stressed by variable and unpredictable generation from various sources. We identify the qualitative framework of ﬂexibility as an adequate tool to specify requirements that allow the system to handle this variability. An open problem is the quantiﬁcation of technical ﬂexibility that incorporates limitations from transmission system and component behavior in contrast to existing copper plate supply and demand balance approaches. We develop such a quantitative method for single components on the basis of a priori speciﬁed reliability criteria. Our framework bases on a combined static power ﬂow and small signal stability analysis. In a perturbative approach we derive sensitivity-based formula for eigenvalue variations under nonlinear changes of steady power ﬂow set points. To this end, we deﬁne rigorously the terms ﬂexibility metric and technical ﬂexibility of single components. We provide an algorithmic procedure for computation of tolerance ranges of individual system components such that the overall behavior remains reliable.},

  abstract = {Power systems have traditionally been designed to provide flexibility in a context where demand is met by bulk generation. The integration of variable and uncertain renewable generation sources, such as wind, increases the flexibility needed to maintain the load-generation balance. This paper aims to provide a systematic approach to evaluate the flexibility level and investigate the role of flexibility in generation planning and market operation. An “offline” index is proposed to estimate the technical ability of both the individual generators and the generation mix to provide the required flexibility. A dedicated unit construction and commitment (UCC) algorithm, able to consider plant investment and operation costs, is developed to determine the optimal investments in flexible generating units. Market simulation models are then implemented to determine the profits obtained from providing flexibility in different market designs. An adapted RTS-96 system is used to test the proposed models and the flexibility metric. Results demonstrate the validity of the UCC algorithm and the coherence of the proposed flexibility index. The analysis of the profits of flexibility shows that the market design plays an important role in the efficient deployment and subsequent profitability of flexibility resources.},

  abstract = {Taking advantage of various flexible resources to reduce or even eliminate renewable energy (RE) curtailment is an important issue in the operational planning of future power systems. Building a highly compatible flexibility evaluation method that incorporates a clear relation between flexibility indices and RE curtailment is crucial to addressing this issue. A novel flexibility evaluation methodology is proposed based on the probabilistic distribution of flexibility adequacy. The novel indices can reflect the direction, amount, frequency, and consequence of lack of flexibility and also have a linear relationship with RE curtailment, features that are beneficial for planners aiming to determine the type of flexible resources needed and to quantify their capacity. The conditional probability distribution functions of different types of flexible resources are first built. Then, a unified form of flexibility on different time-scales is proposed to represent and calculate their contributions to flexible indices using conditional probability convolution. The evaluation method is validated in a combined heat-and-electricity supply system. Four types of flexible resources are studied to demonstrate the quantitative capability of the proposed method in planning, including conventional units, electricity storage devices, heat storage devices, and electric boilers.},

In this method, a risk index referred to as the ramping capability shortage expectation (RSE) is used to quantify flexibility. The RSE value of the current power system is selected as the adequate level of flexibility (i.e., RSE criterion). VG acceptability is represented by the VG penetration level for the RSE criterion. The proposed evaluation method was applied to the generation expansion plan in Korea for 2029 in order to examine the validity of the existing plan for VG penetration. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to analyze the effects of changes in system uncertainty on VG acceptability. The results show that the planned VG penetration level for 2029 can improve by approximately 12\% while securing flexibility.},

Reliability evaluation of composite power systems has surfaced as an essential step in operation and planning stages of the modern power system. It is an effective tool to investigate the ability of power systems to supply customers with reliable power service. The purpose of this review is to enhance the knowledge of reliability studies conducted on composite power systems by providing a critical and systematic review. This work investigates peer-reviewed articles published between 2007 and 2017 in three reliable databases. The ﬁndings reveal that the reliability of composite power systems has received considerable attention over the last few years. Secondly, investigation studies demonstrated a crucial role in verifying the impact of adopting new technologies. Third, studies on this topic have been intensively conducted in Asia, which highlights the promising sectors in these regions. However, researchers have generally focused on developing several aspects (e.g., evaluation speed and wind power integration) at the expense of others (e.g., realistic studies and other renewable energy resources). The lack of practical applications is evident in the surveyed publications. These ﬁndings imply a potential incoordination between the needs of the real applications and researchers’ tendencies. Future reliability evaluation scholars are advised to consider the ﬁndings of this systematic review including concentrating on insufﬁciently covered topics and enhance the coordination among the efforts devoted in this area.},

However, multi-state elements with different performances have played a significant role in engineering systems. This paper presents an approach for reliability analysis of standby systems composed of multi-state elements with constant state transition rates and absorbing failure states. The approach allows modelling different standby systems beyond cold, warm and hot ones by taking into account differences in possible maintenance of elements in standby and operation modes and dependence of elements' operational behavior on their initial state at the time of activation. An iterative algorithm for reliability evaluation based on element state probabilities is suggested. Illustrating examples of evaluating reliability of different types of homogeneous and heterogeneous standby systems are demonstrated.},
