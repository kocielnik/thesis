  abstract = {Distributed energy resource integration in power systems has advantages and challenges in both the economic and the technical operation of the system. An aggregator, as in the case of a Virtual Power Player, is essential in order to support the operation of these small size resources. Innovative approaches capable of supporting the decisions made in terms of resource scheduling, aggregation and remuneration are needed. The present paper addresses a methodology capable of managing resources through the activities of an aggregator, providing different choices of aggregation and remuneration strategies. The methodology is validated in a case study regarding a 21-bus network, composed of 20 consumers and 26 producers.},

  abstract = {The paper reviews different approaches, technologies, and strategies to manage large-scale schemes of variable renewable electricity such as solar and wind power. We consider both supply and demand side measures. In addition to presenting energy system flexibility measures, their importance to renewable electricity is discussed. The flexibility measures available range from traditional ones such as grid extension or pumped hydro storage to more advanced strategies such as demand side management and demand side linked approaches, e.g. the use of electric vehicles for storing excess electricity, but also providing grid support services. Advanced batteries may offer new solutions in the future, though the high costs associated with batteries may restrict their use to smaller scale applications. Different “P2Y”-type of strategies, where P stands for surplus renewable power and Y for the energy form or energy service to which this excess in converted to, e.g. thermal energy, hydrogen, gas or mobility are receiving much attention as potential flexibility solutions, making use of the energy system as a whole. To “functionalize” or to assess the value of the various energy system flexibility measures, these need often be put into an electricity/energy market or utility service context. Summarizing, the outlook for managing large amounts of RE power in terms of options available seems to be promising.},

  abstract = {To manage fluctuation in demand, organizations usually set safety stocks of finished goods to help buffer fluctuating demand as it arrives from the market. Sometimes called buffer stocks, safety stock inventory is a term used by Supply Chain Managers to describe extra stock that is kept to cover late supplier deliveries and even fluctuating demand. This study looks at determining safety stocks using a statistical approach of determining demand variability to see whether any savings can be made in days of finished goods inventory held. Comparisons between the trial and error approaches versus statistically driven safety stocks using probability and the standard deviation of historical demand will be used to compare the days target of inventory versus actual inventory held for a single organization with multiple warehouses for a fast moving consumer goods business. The findings show that days of inventory can be substantially saved using the statistical approach. In addition, this study will also help Supply Chain Managers to understand sources of demand variation and help them try to minimize the variation before attempting to determine statistically calculated safety stocks in an attempt to reduce costs associated with holding inventory.},

  abstract = {The large penetration rate of renewable energy sources leads to challenges in planning and controlling the energy production, transmission, and distribution in power systems. A potential solution is found in a paradigm shift from traditional supply control to demand control. To address such changes, a first step lays in a formal and robust characterization of the energy flexibility on the demand side. The most common way to characterize the energy flexibility is by considering it as a static function at every time instant. The validity of this approach is questionable because energy-based systems are never at steady-state. Therefore, in this paper, a novel methodology to characterize the energy flexibility as a dynamic function is proposed, which is titled as the Flexibility Function. The Flexibility Function brings new possibilities for enabling the grid operators or other operators to control the demand through the use of penalty signals (e.g., price, CO2, etc.). For instance, CO2-based controllers can be used to accelerate the transition to a fossil-free society. Contrary to previous static approaches to quantify Energy Flexibility, the dynamic nature of the Flexibility Function enables a Flexibility Index, which describes to which extent a building is able to respond to the grid’s need for flexibility. In order to validate the proposed methodologies, a case study is presented, demonstrating how different Flexibility Functions enable the utilization of the flexibility in different types of buildings, which are integrated with renewable energies.},

  abstract = {With the growing use of renewable energy sources, the stability of electrical power systems can be seriously affected by fluctuations in the available power. As one of the potential solutions for this new challenge, the energy flexibility of buildings has become a focus for research and technological development. Most studies have focused on single buildings, with only a few studies on building clusters in which the building models were usually oversimplified in that they did not consider different building types or their thermal characteristics, their occupancy or their occupants’ behaviour. In this paper, we describe a data driven approach to simulating a generic building cluster that could resemble any mix of building archetypes and occupancy. The energy flexibility potential of apartment building clusters was estimated by using data from surveys and available statistics in Denmark for the worst case scenario, i.e. when the end users do not allow any disturbance when they are at home, so that energy flexibility is only available when residents are not at home. In this scenario, no energy flexibility is assumed when buildings are occupied, which yields a conservative estimation. The uncertainty of the energy flexibility potential due to uncertain occupancy and various archetypes was quantified for different scales of building cluster. The resulting hybrid-model is a combination of a building model and an occupancy model and includes the different factors that influence the potential energy flexibility of buildings. The results show that the uncertainty of the energy flexibility decreases when the aggregated number of buildings increases. The uncertainty of energy flexibility was less than 10\%, when about 700 households were aggregated. This approach can be used to simulate building energy flexibility for district or even regional level energy planning when the intention is to use the available flexibility to address the challenges caused by fluctuation in the power available from renewable energy sources.},

  abstract = {In the future due to continued integration of renewable energy sources, demand-side flexibility would be required for managing power grids. Building energy systems will serve as one possible source of energy flexibility. The degree of flexibility provided by building energy systems is highly restricted by power-to-heat conversion such as heat pumps and thermal energy storage possibilities of a building. To quantify building demand flexibility, it is essential to capture the dynamic response of the building energy system with thermal energy storage. To identify the maximum flexibility a building’s energy system can provide, optimal control is required. In this paper, optimal control serves to determine in detail demand flexibility of an office building equipped with heat pump, electric heater, and thermal energy storage tanks. The demand flexibility is quantified using different performance indicators that sufficiently characterize flexibility in terms of size (energy), time (power) and costs. To fully describe power flexibility, the paper introduces the instantaneous power flexibility as power flexibility indicator. The instantaneous power flexibility shows the potential power flexibility of TES and power-to-heat in any case of charging, discharging or idle mode. A simulation case study is performed showing that a water tank, a phase change material tank, and a thermochemical material tank integrated with building heating system can be designed to provide flexibility with optimal control.},

Among these, the scarcity of ramp capability is an important culprit of power balance violations and high scarcity prices. To address this issue, market-based flexible ramping products (FRPs) have been proposed in the industry to improve the availability of ramp capacity. This paper presents an in-depth review of the modeling and implementation of FRPs. The major motivation is that although FRPs are widely discussed in the literature, it is still unclear to many that how they can be incorporated into a co-optimization framework that includes energy and ancillary services. The concept and a definition of power system operational flexibility as well as the needs for FRPs are introduced. The industrial practices of implementing FRPs under different market structures are presented. Market operation issues and future research topics are also discussed. This paper can provide researchers and power engineers with further insights into the state of the art, technical barriers, and potential directions for FRPs.},

  shorttitle = {Measures to Improve Energy Demand Flexibility in Buildings for Demand Response ({{DR}})},
  abstract = {This paper classifies and discusses the energy flexibility improvement strategies for demand responsive control in grid-interactive buildings based on a comprehensive study of the literature. Both supply and demand sides are considered. The flexibility measures range from renewable energy such as photovoltaic cells (PV) and wind to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, energy storage, building thermal mass, appliances, and occupant behaviors. Currently, owing to the highly developed smart appliances and sensing communication techniques, DR is considered as an essential measure for improving energy flexibility in buildings without much additional investment. With the help of advanced demand response (DR) control strategies and measures, buildings can become more flexible in terms of power demand from the power grid. In this way, buildings achieve a better ability to balance differences in energy supply and demand. Furthermore, a synergistic approach with various measures is advisable, e.g., the use of energy storage technologies with PV and passive DR methods. This paper summarizes the measures for improving the flexibility of commercial and residential buildings, and develops a systematic methodology framework to evaluate energy demand flexibility in buildings.},

  abstract = {As part of the transition from distribution network operator to distribution system operator (DSO), decentralised pricing of energy is an area that needs to be considered. This paper considers different roles for the DSO in facilitating distributed markets including the decentralised and centralised approaches. The latest work in distributed markets has been reviewed including two major pilot projects involving DSO type operation of distribution markets. The use of distribution locational marginal prices (DLMPs) in distributed markets has been studied as a promising means of directing investment and managing constraints in distribution systems. Some simple case studies involving DLMPs in an example distribution network were modelled using Matpower and it was seen that marginal prices could result in reduced losses and congestion if DLMPs are passed on to distributed energy resources. A case was considered of a bus with losses resulting in DLMPs 6\% above the grid import cost and it was seen if the DLMP market was used a generator installed at this bus could reduce the cost of losses by up to 14\%.},

  title = {The {{Perfect Formula}}},
  volume = {March},
  abstract = {For years, supply chain executives have asked how can they reduce inventory without affecting customer service levels or shifting cost to other supply chain partners? The answer could be a new inventory management strategy. H AVING THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF INVENTORY when and where it's needed is a key element of corporate success. After all, losing control of inventory eats away at corporate profit margins and costs a firm its customers. As a result, today's CEOs are well versed in inventory strategies such as Just-in-time (JIT), collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment , and shared point of sale data. Yet, the wrong application of the right strategy can be just as costly as no inventory control at all. Reducing the wrong inventory, for instance, often leads to a reduction in customer service levels (CSL) with little impact on cost. That affects customer satisfaction. Strategies such as JIT, on the other hand, often simply shift the cost of carrying inventory back to the vendor with little impact on the total end-to-end total supply chain cost. Eventually, those costs affect all of the players in the supply chain. The result is that supply chain executives are often left scratching their heads and wondering: How can I manage inventory in a way that doesn't impact my customers or leave real money on the table? Our work answers these questions using a new inventory strategy that we call the science of theoretical minimums, or STM. STM provides a simple and elegant framework to reduce cost and increase customer service levels by monetizing time delays across the extended supply chain. Unlike other strategies, managing to theoretical minimums reduces the total supply chain cost instead of simply pushing costs onto weaker suppliers. This means that STM reveals how much profit is being left on the table in the end-to-end supply chain. This monetization of delay cost provides supply chain executives with a clear picture on where to focus their efforts.},

The objective of this chapter is to move beyond existing approaches to better incorporate the material technological arrangements of appliances, infrastructures, and the social rhythms of everyday coordination into analysis of DSR in practice. In so doing we propose clearer definitions of both how flexibility and responsiveness should be understood. Taking the example of hotels as a site of energy demand, we detail which energy loads have potential for demand responsiveness and focus on questions of automation at different stages of the DSR process.},

Smart grids are an emerging trend that introduce intelligence in the power grid to optimize resource usage. In order for this intelligence to be effective, it is necessary to retrieve enough information about the grid operation together with other context data such as environmental variables, and intelligently modify the behavior of the network elements accordingly. This article presents a multi-agent system model for virtual power plants, a new power plant concept in which generation no longer occurs in big installations, but is the result of the cooperation of smaller and more intelligent elements. The proposed model is not only focused on the management of the different elements, but includes a set of agents embedded with artificial neural networks for collaborative forecasting of disaggregated energy demand of domestic end users, the results of which are also shown in this article.},

  abstract = {The development and utilization of information technology in everyday life continues to grow rapidly within the passage of time. As a result, organizations or companies have many choices in determining the information technology to be applied in their organizations or companies. To ensure that information technology solutions implemented by enterprises are able to help companies properly solve their problems, the solution must take into consideration the culture and condition of the enterprises and the capabilities of information technology held at that time. The solution should also be able to integrate the company's data and systems, take advantage of existing enterprises capabilities, and ensure that the enterprises' resources are ready to transform from the current state to the target state. Based on the requirements statement, the right information technology solution to be applied to enterprises is enterprise architecture. From the existing enterprise architecture frameworks, TOGAF framework is chosen as the framework that will be used in this paper by reason of the completeness of the process, integrated processes, and flexibility. Expected results from the design of enterprise architecture in this paper is the target of enterprise architecture to be achieved, gap analysis between the initial architecture and targets, as well as project roadmap to assist enterprises in achieving the desired target and solve their current problems. In this paper, the design of enterprise architecture by applying TOGAF framework will be done on one of state-owned enterprises (BUMN) in Indonesia.},

  abstract = {The circular economy is central to the agenda of responsible production and consumption with propositions for the conservation of natural resources and a broader understanding of the obligations of enterprises and product developers. The circular economy is challenging traditional operating models of enterprises due to the need to manage larger parts of the product life cycle and value chains. A linear economy will normally address a smaller part of the life cycle. The operating models of companies are supported with respect to information and technology with an enterprise architecture model. This article examines the necessary steps for analysing and designing the enterprise architecture model, aiming to facilitate the transformation of an enterprise from operating in a linear to operating in a circular economy model. The fundamentals and requirements of the circular economy enterprise are extracted to isolate the design requirements for the operating model, entailing cross-enterprise collaboration, traceability, and a broader value chain understanding. Furthermore, it conceptualizes enterprise architecture and its role and importance in connecting business strategies and operating technologies. This article develops an enterprise architecture framework, named the Circular Economy Enterprise Architecture Framework (CEEAF), which can form and support the effort of transitioning companies or be embedded into existing enterprise architecture frameworks. The CEEAF differs from traditional enterprise architecture frameworks by addressing the broader responsibility of the enterprise, the extended enterprise, the elimination of end-of-life perspectives and mind-sets, and the capabilities of the individual enterprise and its design activities.},

  abstract = {Existing package and system configuration management tools suffer from an imperative model, where system administration actions such as upgrading packages or changes to system configuration files are stateful: they destructively update the state of the system. This leads to many problems, such as the inability to roll back changes easily, to run multiple versions of a package side-by-side, to reproduce a configuration deterministically on another machine, or to reliably upgrade a system. In this paper we show that we can overcome these problems by moving to a purely functional system configuration model. This means that all static parts of a system (such as software packages, configuration files and system startup scripts) are built by pure functions and are immutable, stored in a way analogously to a heap in a purely function language. We have implemented this model in NixOS, a non-trivial Linux distribution that uses the Nix package manager to build the entire system configuration from a purely functional specification.},

Author Joshua Backfield begins slowly by showing you how to apply the most useful implementation concepts before taking you further into functional-style concepts and practices.In each chapter, you’ll learn a functional concept and then use it to refactor the fictional XXY company’s imperative-style legacy code, writing and testing the functional code yourself. As you progress through the book, you’ll migrate from Java 7 to Groovy and finally to Scala as the need for better functional language support gradually increases.Learn why today’s finely tuned applications work better with functional codeTransform imperative-style patterns into functional code, following basic stepsGet up to speed with Groovy and Scala through examplesUnderstand how first-class functions are passed and returned from other functionsConvert existing methods into pure functions, and loops into recursive methodsChange mutable variables into immutable variablesGet hands-on experience with statements and nonstrict evaluationsUse functional programming alongside object-oriented design},

  abstract = {Household smart meters that measure power consumption in real-time at ﬁne granularities are the foundation of a future smart electricity grid. However, the widespread deployment of smart meters has serious privacy implications since they inadvertently leak detailed information about household activities. In this paper, we show that even without a priori knowledge of household activities or prior training, it is possible to extract complex usage patterns from smart meter data using off-the-shelf statistical methods. Our analysis uses two months of data from three homes, which we instrumented to log aggregate household power consumption every second. With the data from our small-scale deployment, we demonstrate the potential for power consumption patterns to reveal a range of information, such as how many people are in the home, sleeping routines, eating routines, etc. We then sketch out the design of a privacy-enhancing smart meter architecture that allows an electric utility to achieve its net metering goals without compromising the privacy of its customers.},

  abstract = {Smart electricity meters have been replacing conventional meters worldwide, enabling automated collection of fine-grained (e.g., every 15 minutes or hourly) consumption data. A variety of smart meter analytics algorithms and applications have been proposed, mainly in the smart grid literature. However, the focus has been on what can be done with the data rather than how to do it efficiently. In this paper, we examine smart meter analytics from a software performance perspective. First, we design a performance benchmark that includes common smart meter analytics tasks. These include off-line feature extraction and model building as well a framework for on-line anomaly detection that we propose. Second, since obtaining real smart meter data is difficult due to privacy issues, we present an algorithm for generating large realistic data sets from a small seed of real data. Third, we implement the proposed benchmark using five representative platforms: a traditional numeric computing platform (Matlab), a relational DBMS with a built-in machine learning toolkit (PostgreSQL/MADlib), a main-memory column store (“System C”), and two distributed data processing platforms (Hive and Spark/Spark Streaming). We compare the five platforms in terms of application development effort and performance on a multicore machine as well as a cluster of 16 commodity servers.},
